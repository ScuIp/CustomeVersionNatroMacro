# Natro-Alt-Synchronization Extension for Natro Macro v1.0.1

---

## ‚ú® Features  


- **Windows 11 Aero Theme**  
  I've added the **Aero theme** inside the `guitheme` of Natro Macro for a cleaner Windows 11‚Äìstyle look.  
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently only works in **Light Mode** (not compatible with Dark Mode).  


- **Natro-Alt-Synchronization Extension**  
  Adds the ability to synchronize an alt account with your main account to gather in the same field.  
  - Especially useful for **Tad alts in blue hives**.  
  - Allows players to use boosts (Gained from the blue field booster.) in fields they normally wouldn‚Äôt gather in.  
  - Based on the original **Tad Synchronization extension**, updated for the latest version of Natro Macro.
